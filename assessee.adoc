== Script ==

Hi, I'm <INSERT NAME> from the <OFFICE> office. Would you have 10 mins to talk about your experience with the current review / assessment process?

== Questions ==
. How many people do you typically ask to review you?
. How long does it you usually take you to complete your self review?
. Have you incorporated feedback from peers into your review? Why?
. What type of information would you hope to get from a peer review and do you usually get that information?
. How do you advertise what skills you have to others in your resume?
. Have you asked other peers to endorse your skills and if so how did you put them in communication
